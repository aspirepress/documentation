## What is AspireCloud?

[AspireCloud](https://github.com/aspirepress/AspireCloud) is an open source project that functions as a CDN and a set of API endpoints for distributing WordPress assets (themes, plugins, core) to users of the [AspirePress Update](/aspireupdate/) plugin.

The following is the architecture of AspireCloud federation/defederation model. In Phase 1, the federation concept is not yet supported.

    Server2A --- UserG(("WP Website D")) & UserH(("WP Website E"))
